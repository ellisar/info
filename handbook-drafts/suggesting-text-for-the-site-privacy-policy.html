[sub of Privacy]

Every plugin that collects, uses, or stores user data, or passes it to an external source or third party, should add a section of suggested text to the privacy policy postbox. This is best done with<code> wp_add_privacy_policy_content( $plugin_name, $policy_text )</code>. This will allow site administrators to pull that information into their site's privacy policy.

To make this simpler for the users, the text should address the questions provided in the default privacy policy:
<ul>
 	<li>What personal data we collect and why we collect it
<ul>
 	<li>Their own manually input information</li>
 	<li>WP: Contact forms</li>
 	<li>WP: Comments</li>
 	<li>WP: Cookies</li>
 	<li>WP: Third party embeds</li>
 	<li>Analytics</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Who we share your data with</li>
 	<li>How long we retain your data</li>
 	<li>What rights you have over your data</li>
 	<li>Where we send your data</li>
 	<li>Your contact information</li>
 	<li>How we protect your data</li>
 	<li>What data breach procedures we have in place</li>
 	<li>What third parties we receive data from</li>
 	<li>What automated decision making and/or profiling we do with user data</li>
 	<li>Any industry regulatory disclosure requirements</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
While not all of these questions will be applicable to all plugins, we recommend taking care with the sections on data sharing.
